# CS120-Catch-Cash

Algorithm(?):

Essentially, I copied and pasted the catch the cash code
BUT:
I changed it a bit:

Changes:
- I changed the graphics and sounds
- - The coins are now cars, Charlie is now Cuddle the cuttlefish, the collision sound is a honking sound, and there is background game music. There are also different backgrounds for the intro and game scenes.
- I changed a bit of the mechanics
- - Cuddle moves up and down, rather than left and right
  - The cars move left to right, rather than up to down. They are faster than the coins, but there are also less cars than there were coins.
  - Instead of the cars resetting after collision, Cuddle resets.
- I changed how the score works
- - Instead of the score going up when you collide, the score goes up when you avoid collision
  - Score goes up quite fast.
  - You will lose 150 points every time you collide with a car
- I changed the amount of time given to play to be 25 seconds.
- The Score shown in the intro scene now has a clear background

Slight issues:
- Sometimes cars will drive through where Cuddle resets. The user will struggle to move Cuddle if they get caught by a car (because they will continuously reset to that position), and will lose a lot of their score.
